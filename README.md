# Eloquent Consumer package test app

This is a simple example on how to use the [Eloquent Consumer](https://github.com/ferpetrelli/eloquent-consumer) package.

Please check the `app\ApiConsumer` directory and the `Coin` model to see how it works.

Then directly into the routes file you will see some queries executed against these API's.
